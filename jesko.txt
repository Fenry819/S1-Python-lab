The Jesko model range is named after Jesko von
Koenigsegg, the father of company Founder and CEO,
Christian von Koenigsegg.

They feature a redesigned 5.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine
producing 1280 hp on standard gasoline and 1600 hp on
E85 biofuel (in some markets) alongside the revolutionary
new 9-speed Koenigsegg Light Speed Transmission
(LST) system. Advanced aerodynamics offer over 1000 kg
of downforce, making it the ultimate track weapon.
